# SAP CRP Demo Workflow Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive end-to-end demo workflow for the SAP Collaborative Resolution Platform (CRP) demonstration. Follow these steps to showcase the complete ticket lifecycle from submission to resolution.

## Demo Workflow Overview

The demo workflow consists of four main stages:

1. **Customer Ticket Submission** - Submit a new support ticket through the Customer Portal
2. **Lead Engineer Classification** - Review AI-classified ticket and trigger CRP for complex issues
3. **Collaborative Resolution** - Work on decomposed issue threads in the CRP
4. **Verification & Testing** - Verify the end-to-end workflow and test all components

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Stage 1: Customer Ticket Submission

1. Navigate to the Customer Portal (/customer-portal)
2. Fill out the ticket submission form:
   - Enter a descriptive subject
   - Provide a detailed description of the issue
   - Select an urgency level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Choose an affected SAP system
   - Upload any relevant attachments (optional)
3. Submit the ticket
4. Observe the confirmation message with the generated ticket ID

### Stage 2: Lead Engineer Classification

1. Navigate to the Lead Engineer Dashboard (/lead-dashboard)
2. Review the incoming ticket with AI-generated metadata:
   - Urgency score
   - Complexity estimate
   - Required skill tags
   - Recommended action (CRP vs. Standard Queue)
3. Select the ticket to view lead engineer assignment based on the 70% skill dominance rule
4. Click "Trigger CRP" for complex tickets or "Route to Standard" for simpler issues
5. Observe the AI processing animation and status updates

### Stage 3: Collaborative Resolution

1. Navigate to the CRP for the specific ticket (/crp/{ticketId})
2. Review the parent ticket header with original details
3. Examine the AI-generated issue threads:
   - Thread titles and descriptions
   - Required skills for each thread
   - Priority levels
4. Observe engineer availability in the sidebar
5. Click "Pull Thread" on various threads to simulate engineer assignment
6. Update thread statuses from "Open" to "In Progress" to "Resolved"
7. Use the merge solution functionality when all threads are resolved
8. Complete the parent ticket resolution

### Stage 4: Verification & Testing

1. Navigate to the "Demo Workflow Testing" tab in the Lead Engineer Dashboard
2. Run the comprehensive tests to verify:
   - Navigation flow through all stages
   - Thread decomposition accuracy
   - Lead engineer assignment logic
   - UI consistency and branding
3. Review test results and address any failures
4. Verify that all requirements have been demonstrated

## Demo Scenarios

The demo includes multiple pre-defined scenarios with varying complexity levels:

1. **Data Migration Failure** (High Complexity)
   - Critical data migration failure with data integrity issues
   - Multiple threads spanning Database, Backend, Integration, and Analytics skills

2. **Security Compliance Audit** (High Complexity)
   - Critical security compliance issues from external audit
   - Threads covering Security, Network, Backend, and DevOps skills

3. **Integration Breakdown** (Medium Complexity)
   - Integration failure between SAP and third-party systems
   - Threads focusing on Integration, Backend, and Network skills

4. **Performance Degradation** (Medium Complexity)
   - Gradual performance degradation across multiple modules
   - Threads covering Database, Backend, and Analytics skills

5. **Mobile App Crash** (Low Complexity)
   - Mobile application crashes when accessing specific functionality
   - Threads covering Mobile, Frontend, and Backend skills

## Testing Verification Checklist

- [ ] Customer Portal was visited during the workflow
- [ ] Lead Engineer Dashboard was visited during the workflow
- [ ] CRP was visited during the workflow
- [ ] All workflow stages were properly transitioned
- [ ] Threads were created for the ticket
- [ ] Threads have appropriate skill requirements
- [ ] Threads can be assigned to engineers
- [ ] Lead engineer was assigned to the ticket
- [ ] CRP was triggered for the ticket
- [ ] SAP branding elements are present across the application
- [ ] Responsive design elements are implemented
- [ ] Accessibility features are implemented

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the demo:

1. **Reset System Status** - Use the "Reset System Status" button in the Demo Settings
2. **Load a New Scenario** - Select a different scenario from the dropdown
3. **Clear Workflow State** - Use the "Reset Workflow" button in the Demo Workflow Guide
4. **Refresh the Page** - As a last resort, refresh the page to reset the application state

## Best Practices for Demo Presentation

1. **Start with a High Complexity Scenario** - Showcase the full capabilities of the CRP
2. **Highlight AI Classification** - Emphasize the AI-generated metadata and routing decisions
3. **Focus on Thread Decomposition** - Showcase how complex tickets are broken down into manageable threads
4. **Demonstrate Parallel Resolution** - Highlight how multiple engineers can work simultaneously on different threads
5. **Show the Efficiency Gain** - Compare the parallel resolution approach to traditional sequential processing
