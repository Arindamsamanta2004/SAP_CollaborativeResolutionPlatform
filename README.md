# SAP Collaborative Resolution Platform (CRP) Demo

A low-fidelity web application demonstration of the AI-powered Hybrid Intelligent Ticket Assignment & Collaborative Resolution Platform for SAP Ideathon.

## 🚀 Overview

This demo showcases the core innovation of intelligent ticket decomposition into skill-based threads with collaborative resolution, moving beyond traditional sequential routing to parallel, intelligent assignment.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Innovation
- **Intelligent Thread Decomposition**: AI-powered breakdown of complex tickets into skill-based threads
- **Collaborative Resolution**: Parallel processing by specialized engineers
- **Lead Engineer Assignment**: 70% skill dominance rule for optimal leadership
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Thread-specific chat and coordination

### 🏗️ Architecture Components
1. **Customer Portal** - Ticket submission interface (simulating SAP Service Cloud C4C)
2. **Lead Engineer Dashboard** - AI classification and routing decisions
3. **Collaborative Resolution Platform** - Thread-based collaborative resolution
4. **Simulated AI Engine** - Pre-defined scenarios and intelligent routing

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: SAP UI5 Web Components
- **Styling**: SAP Fiori design tokens and branding
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arindamsamanta2004/SAP_CollaborativeResolutionPlatform.git
cd SAP_CollaborativeResolutionPlatform/sap-crp-demo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Demo Authentication

The application automatically logs you in with a demo user for demonstration purposes:
- **Username**: demo.user
- **Role**: Lead Engineer
- **Department**: IT Support

## 🎮 Demo Workflow

### 1. Customer Portal (`/customer-portal`)
- Submit support tickets with attachments
- Professional SAP Fiori-styled interface
- File upload for screenshots and recordings
- Immediate routing to AI processing

### 2. Lead Engineer Dashboard (`/`)
- View AI-classified tickets with metadata
- See urgency scores, complexity estimates, and skill tags
- Trigger CRP for complex tickets
- Lead engineer auto-assignment based on skill dominance

### 3. Collaborative Resolution Platform (`/crp/:id`)
- View decomposed issue threads
- Engineer availability and workload tracking
- Thread assignment ("Pull Thread" mechanism)
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Solution merge functionality

## 🧠 AI Simulation Features

- **Ticket Classification**: Complexity scoring and skill tagging
- **Thread Decomposition**: Template-based issue breakdown
- **Skill Mapping**: Engineer expertise matching
- **Lead Assignment**: 70% skill dominance algorithm

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

The application includes pre-defined scenarios demonstrating:
- Email system failures with database errors
- Frontend authentication issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Security token validation errors
- Integration API failures

## 🎨 SAP Fiori Compliance

- Official SAP branding and logo placement
- SAP Fiori design tokens and color palette
- Responsive grid layouts
- Professional typography
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

- `npm run eject` - Eject from Create React App

## 🌟 Key Innovation Demonstrations

### Thread Decomposition Example
A complex ticket like "Email system failure with database errors" gets intelligently broken into:
- **Database Thread**: "Investigate database connection issues" → DBA
- **Email Service Thread**: "Check SMTP server configuration" → DevOps  
- **Frontend Thread**: "Validate email form submission" → Frontend Engineer
- **Security Thread**: "Review authentication tokens" → Security Engineer

### Lead Engineer Assignment
Demonstrates the 70% skill dominance rule:
- Ticket requires: 70% Backend, 20% Database, 10% Frontend
- **Lead Assignment**: Backend Engineer becomes lead
- **Collaboration**: DBA and Frontend Engineer added as collaborators
